# Literature Review

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[Context]

.pull-left[

This longitudinal case study **examines reform-related knowledge, advice, and innovation network structures** among administrators in a districcde fg
t sanction for under-performance and engaging a districtwide reform.
]

.pull-right[

.center[<img src="img/daly-net.jpeg" height="320px"/>]
]

]

.panel[.panel-name[Questions]

This study involves quantifying and graphically displaying the ties and overall structure of informal networks to answer the following research questions: 

1. In what ways have reform-related social networks between district and site leaders evolved over a 2-year period? 
2. How do district and school leaders perceive the evolution of the social networks and its effect on the exchange of reform-related resources within the district?
]

.panel[.panel-name[Data]
To answer RQ1, Daly and Finnigan administered **online survey consisting of network relations and demographic questions** asking participants to:
- select the administrators in the La Estasis network that you go to for knowledge
- to assess their relationships on a 5-point interaction scale ranging from 1 (no interaction) to 5 (1 to 2 times a week).
- 

]

.panel[.panel-name[Key Findings]

Findings indicate that over time, the networks **increased the number of superficial interactions**, but more frequent exchanges remained unchanged, resulting in a centralized network structure.

# Load Packages

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[Load Libraries]

Let's start by loading the following packages introduced in previous units:          

```{r load-libraries, message=TRUE, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}
library(readxl)
library(tidyverse)
library(tidygraph)
library(ggraph)
```


]

.panel[.panel-name[igraph ðŸ“¦]

The {igraph} <img src="img/igraph.png" height="40px"/> package and its collection of network analysis tools provide:

1. pain-free implementation of graph algorithms, 
1. 
1. fast handling of large graphs, with millions of vertices and edges, and

Both {tidygraph} and {ggraph} used in the previous unit and this unit depend heavily on the {igraph} package. 

]


.panel[.panel-name[Your Turn]

Load the {igraph} package.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(igraph)
```

```{r load-igraph, echo=TRUE}
# YOUR CODE HERE


```

]

]

---

# Import Data   

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[Import Data]

Let's import two Excel files from the Social Network Analysis and Education companion site. year_1_collaboration.xlsx 

```{r import-data, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}
year_1_collaboration <- read_excel("data/year_1_collaboration.xlsx", 
                                   col_names = FALSE)
```


]

.panel[.panel-name[Inspect Data]

In the corresponding line of your R script, take a look at the data file we just imported:

```{r inspect-data, echo=TRUE}
# ADD CODE BELOW
#
#

```


]

.panel[.panel-name[Discuss]

Think about the questions below and be prepared to share your response:              

1. What type of data structure is used to store this network data? 
1. What do you think the rows and columns represent? what about the values in each cell?  
1. 

]

.panel[.panel-name[Answer]

- This adjacency matrix reports on **"collaboration" ties among 43 school leaders** in year 1 of a three-year study. 

- This is **a directed valued (weighted) network** measured on five-point scale ranging from 0 to 4, with higher values indicating more frequent collaborations (1â€“2 times/week).

# Network Density 

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[Definition]

.pull-left[ In its simplest form,  network density is **the proportion of existing ties in network to all possible ties** that could potentially exist, regardless of whether they do.
]

.pull-right[ .center[<img src="img/density.jpeg" height="150px"/>

Which of these two networks has a higher density?
]
 
]

]

.panel[.panel-name[Significance]
To help improve performance, TM is used to  **provide student feedback**, often based on both their interactions and activities 

- Intelligent Tutoring Systems
- Question-answering applications
- Assist teacher  feedback
- Support formative feedback

]

.panel[.panel-name[Implementation]
TM has been applied to **support student engagement and collaboration**, especially in distance learning courses. 

- Automated writing scaffolds
- Analysis of interactional resources
- Student sentiment extraction
- Dropout prevention
]

.panel[.panel-name[Your Turn]
Other applications of text mining in STEM Ed Research include: 
- Automatic text summarization
- Analytics & visualization tools
- Curriculum adaptation
- Recommendation systems
