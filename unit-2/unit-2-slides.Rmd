# Guiding Literature

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[Context]

.pull-left[This longitudinal case study draws upon SNA to **examine the reform-related knowledge, advice, and innovation network structures of central office and site leaders** in a district facing sanction for underperformance and engaging a districtwide reform.]

.pull-right[.center[<img src="img/daly-net.jpeg" height="320px"/>]]


]

.panel[.panel-name[Questions]

This study involves quantifying and graphically displaying the ties and overall structure of informal networks to answer the following research questions: 

1. In what ways have reform-related social networks between district and site leaders evolved over a 2-year period? 
2. How do district and school leaders perceive the evolution of the social networks and its effect on the exchange of reform-related resources within the district?
]

.panel[.panel-name[Findings]

Findings indicate that over time, the networks **increased the number of superficial interactions**, but more frequent exchanges remained unchanged, resulting in a centralized network structure.

# Packages

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[Load Libraries]

Let's start by loading the following packages introduced in previous units:          

```{r load-libraries, message=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
library(readxl)
library(tidyverse)
library(tidygraph)
library(ggraph)
```


]

.panel[.panel-name[igraph ðŸ“¦]

The {igraph} package and its collection of network analysis tools provide:

1. pain-free implementation of graph algorithms,
1. fast handling of large graphs, with millions of vertices and edges, and
1. rapid prototyping via high level languages like R.

Both {tidygraph} and {ggraph} depend heavily on the {igraph} package. 



]

.panel[.panel-name[Your Turn]

Load the {igraph} package.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(igraph)
```

# Network Density 

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[Definition]

TM has been largely used to **evaluate academic  performance** in different contexts, especially to assess essays and online assignments.

- writing style
- use of argumentation
- plagiarism detection
- peer interaction
]

.panel[.panel-name[Applications]
To help improve performance, TM is used to  **provide student feedback**, often based on both their interactions and activities 

- Intelligent Tutoring Systems
- Question-answering applications
- Assist teacher  feedback
- Support formative feedback

]

.panel[.panel-name[Implementation]
TM has been applied to **support student engagement and collaboration**, especially in distance learning courses. 

- Automated writing scaffolds
- Analysis of interactional resources
- Student sentiment extraction
- Dropout prevention
]

.panel[.panel-name[Your Turn]
Other applications of text mining in STEM Ed Research include: 
- Automatic text summarization
- Analytics & visualization tools
- Curriculum adaptation
- Recommendation systems

# Showing Your Code
```{r example-code, echo=TRUE}
example <- sum(0:9)
print(example)

# adding #<< after a line of code highlights it like this 
alphabet <- letters #<<
print(alphabet)
```
