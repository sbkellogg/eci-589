## Overview

Throughout this course, we've completed several case studies modeled after the Data-Intensive Research Workflow from Learning Analytics Goes to School [@krumm2018] and incorporating approaches from Social Network Analysis and Education [@carolan2014]. For the end-of-course project, you'll be applying the knowledge and skills gained throughout this semester to conduct the independent analysis proposed in the previous assignment. Similar to the case studies provided in this course, your analysis should demonstrate your ability to wrangle, analyze, and communicate findings in response to a research question of interest. You will also be expected to use [R Markdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/) (or [Quarto](https://quarto.org) if preferred) to create a reproducible data product (e.g., slide show, dashboard, report, mini "data product", etc.), which contains all the code used during each step of your analysis so it can be reproduced by others.

## Assignment

In preparation for your final project, you will read [Chapter 12](https://sbkellogg.github.io/eci-589/unit-6/lit/carolan-sna-ch-12.pdf) from [Social Network Analysis and Education](https://catalog.lib.ncsu.edu/catalog/NCSU2803782), which summarizes the theories, methods, and applications that constitute the interdisciplinary field of social network analysis; reiterates SNA's limitations; and provides some important guidance for doing your own social network analysis in educational research. Please also skim through [Chapter 10](https://methods-sagepub-com.prox.lib.ncsu.edu/book/social-network-analysis-and-education/n10.xml) and [Chapter 11](https://methods-sagepub-com.prox.lib.ncsu.edu/book/social-network-analysis-and-education). These chapters connect the methods, measures, and techniques presented in the previous five chapters to two rich theoretical areas -- social capital and diffusion -- to which educational researchers have made important contributions.

This week also provides some space to plan and conceptualize your **final course project, due April 28th**. More details about the actual content and format of your case study are provided in Part 2, but in general, you are welcome to model your write-up after one of the case studies from prior units, minus the Your Turns. While your case studies are meant to be informative rather than instructional, I would love to use your analyses in future sections of ECI 589 as models for other students.

To help plan for your final project, your assignment is to: 1) create a forum post that addresses the questions below and 2) provide constructive feedback on proposed final course projects for at least two of your peers.

### Prepare

1.  What prior research, if any, inspired your case study and what **data source(s)**, will you be using for your analysis?

2.  Why are you interested in this data/context and what **research question(s)** are you hoping to answer with your analysis?

3.  Who would most benefit from your analysis and why? How might your **target audience** use this information to take action?

### Wrangle

4.  What **data cleaning** steps do you anticipate taking to prepare your data for analysis and why are they necessary?

5.  What other **variables/features** (e.g. student grades, schools, dates, tweets, chapter numbers, demographics, etc.) might you need to include to address your research questions?

### Explore & Model (Analysis)

6.  What **metrics** (e.g., percents, counts, p-values, sentiment values, degree, density, etc.) will you calculate and examine? And at what stage of your analysis?

7.  What **tables or charts** (e.g. text networks, word clouds, etc?) might you include to help readers understand and interpret your findings?

8.  While not required, what modeling **techniques** (e.g., logistic regression, random forests, sentiment analysis, community detection, etc.), if any, will you use to analyze your data and how do you anticipate these techniques will help you address your research questions?

### Communicate

9.  What **key insights** do you anticipate finding as a result of your analysis? Why would they be useful and what actions might they result in by your target audience?

10. What **ethical/legal issues,** if any, need to be taken into consideration?

## Potential Data Sources

You are welcome to reuse any data set provided during the course, provide you use it to address a research question we have not addressed and can provide some new insight. You are also welcome to collect your own network data or locate a data set online. There are several sources where you can find social network data sets related to an educational context. Included below are links to data we have used in this course, as well as some additional sources to start with:

1.  **Social Network Analysis and Education**: The example data sets used in Social Network Analysis and Education [@carolan2014] are in an Excel (.xls) file format, which can either be directly imported or copied into your preferred social network analysis software. Visit the website at <https://studysites.sagepub.com/carolan/study/resources.htm>.

2.  **Massively Open Online Course for Educators (MOOC-Ed) network dataset**: These dataset provide detailed information on the communications taking place between learners in two offerings of the Massively Open Online Course for Educators (MOOC-Eds) titled The Digital Learning Transition in K-12 Schools. Visit the website at <https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/ZZH3UB>

3.  **The UCI Network Data Repository:** This repository is an effort to facilitate the scientific study of networks. Feel free to browse and download any available datasets. If you're just getting your feet wet, check out the [Getting Started](#0) help page. Visit their website at <http://networkdata.ics.uci.edu>.

4.  **Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection (SNAP)**: SNAP offers a wide variety of large network datasets, some of which are related to educational settings, like collaboration networks and online discussion platforms. Visit their website at <https://snap.stanford.edu/data/>

5.  **GitHub**: Some researchers and organizations share their datasets on GitHub. You can search for educational social network datasets using appropriate keywords. For example, you can use the search query **`educational social network dataset`**. Visit GitHub at <https://github.com>.

6.  **Pajek Datasets**: Pajek is a software for analyzing and visualizing large networks. They provide some datasets, including those related to educational settings, like co-authorship networks. Visit their dataset collection at <http://vlado.fmf.uni-lj.si/pub/networks/data/>

7.  **Gephi Datasets**: Gephi is a popular open-source network analysis and visualization software. They provide a list of datasets, including some that are relevant to educational settings. Visit their dataset page at <https://github.com/gephi/gephi/wiki/Datasets>

8.  **Academic Torrents**: Academic Torrents is a platform for researchers to share their data, including social network datasets. You can search for educational social network datasets by visiting their website at <http://academictorrents.com/>

Remember to check the licensing and terms of use for each dataset, as some may have restrictions on how they can be used. Additionally, it is essential to handle any data containing personal information responsibly and adhere to privacy regulations.
