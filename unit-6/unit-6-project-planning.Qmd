## Overview

Throughout this course, we've completed several case studies modeled after the Data-Intensive Research Workflow from Learning Analytics Goes to School [@krumm2018] and incorporating approaches from Social Network Analysis and Education [@carolan2014]. For the end-of-course project, you'll be applying the knowledge and skills gained throughout this semester to conduct the independent analysis proposed in the previous assignment. Similar to the case studies provided in this course, your analysis should demonstrate your ability to wrangle, analyze, and communicate findings in response to a research question of interest. You will also be expected to use [R Markdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/) (or [Quarto](https://quarto.org) if preferred) to create a reproducible data product (e.g., slide show, dashboard, report, mini "data product", etc.), which contains all the code used during each step of your analysis so it can be reproduced by others.

## Assignment

In preparation for your final project, you will read [Chapter 12](https://sbkellogg.github.io/eci-589/unit-6/lit/carolan-sna-ch-12.pdf) from [Social Network Analysis and Education](https://catalog.lib.ncsu.edu/catalog/NCSU2803782), which summarizes the theories, methods, and applications that constitute the interdisciplinary field of social network analysis; reiterates SNA's limitations; and provides some important guidance for doing your own social network analysis in educational research. Please also skim through [Chapter 10](https://methods-sagepub-com.prox.lib.ncsu.edu/book/social-network-analysis-and-education/n10.xml) and [Chapter 11](https://methods-sagepub-com.prox.lib.ncsu.edu/book/social-network-analysis-and-education). These chapters connect the methods, measures, and techniques presented in the previous five chapters to two rich theoretical areas -- social capital and diffusion -- to which educational researchers have made important contributions.

This week also provides some space to plan and conceptualize your **final course project, due April 28th**. More details about the actual content and format of your case study are provided in Part 2, but in general, you are welcome to model your write-up after one of the case studies from prior units, minus the Your Turns. While your case studies are meant to be informative rather than instructional, I would love to use your analyses in future sections of ECI 589 as models for other students.

## Grading Criteria

Grading criteria for your final project is guided by the Data-Intensive Research Workflow from [Learning analytics goes to school: A collaborative approach to improving education](https://catalog.lib.ncsu.edu/catalog/NCSU4862134) (Krumm, Means, & Bienkowski, 2018).

### Prepare

Your data product should demonstrate your ability to formulate clear, actionable research questions relevant to a targeted audience. Specifically, your data product should include an **introduction** that:

1.  Clearly describes the **purpose** of your data product, including the research question(s) guiding your analyses.

2.  Provides information about the **data sources**, including the context in which the data was collected and variables used to address your research questions.

### Wrangle

Your data project should demonstrate your ability to use R to manipulate, clean, transform, and/or merging data in order to prepare your text for analysis. Specifically, your data product should clearly describe:

3.  **Data preprocessing** steps (e.g., renaming variables, filtering, tokenization, stemming, stop words removal, etc.) taken to clean and prepare your text for analysis and why are they necessary, as well as any steps will excluded and why.

4.  Any **new variables or features** you created to address your research questions; or any data **transformations** you made required for the types of analyses or packages used (e.g. reshaping, merging, joining etc.).

### Analyze

Your data project should demonstrate your ability to use R to apply text mining techniques appropriate to your research questions and data sources. Specifically, your data product should clearly include:

5.  Clear descriptions of the **techniques** (e.g., descriptive statistics, network analysis, sentiment analysis, etc.) you applied to analyze your data.

6.  Interpretations/meanings of specific **metrics** (e.g., counts, means, proportions, sentiment values, centrality measures, etc.) that your analysis generated. 

7.  Data **visualizations** that are attractive and easy to interpret, and include text or narrative for aiding their Interpretation by others.

### Communication

Your data product should demonstrate your ability to clearly and effectively communicate the most important and most useful findings. Specifically, your data product should:

8.  Highlights **key finding and insights** in response to your research questions. 

9.  Suggests potential **action** that you and/or your target audience to better understand and improve the context in which your data product is intended to inform.  

10. Discusses the **limitations** and any ethical/legal issues taken into consideration, including acknowledgments any reference materials used.
