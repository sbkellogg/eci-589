# Syllabus

## **Course Overview**

Although social network analysis and its educational antecedents date back to the early 1900s, the popularity of social networking sites like Twitter and Facebook have raised awareness of and renewed interests in networks and their influence. As the use of digital resources continues expand in education, data collected by these educational technologies has also greatly facilitated the application of network analysis to teaching and learning. This introductory course is designed to prepare education researchers and practitioners to apply network analysis in order to better understand and improve student learning and the contexts in which learning occurs. This course will provide students with an overview of social network theory, examples of network analysis in educational contexts, and applied experience with widely adopted tools and techniques. As participants gain experience in the collection, analysis, and reporting of data throughout the course, they will be better prepared help educational organizations understand and improve both online and blended learning environments.

This course is part of the [Graduate Certificate in Learning Analytics Program](https://ced.ncsu.edu/graduate/programs/certificate/learning-analytics/) and is open to all Masters and Doctoral students. ECI 586 Introduction to Learning Analytics and/or prior experience with R and RStudio is recommended for students but not required. For those new to R and RStudio, however, tutorials will be provided.

## **Goals and Objectives**

Course goals for ECI 589: Analyzing Learning Networks are guided by the North Carolina State University motto: *Think and Do.* Specifically, goals for this course are twofold:

1.  **Think.** Students will deepen their understanding of Social Network Analysis as an emerging approach within the field of Learning Analytics and education research, including its application in a wide range of educational settings. 

2.  **Do.** Scholars will develop proficiency with the processes, tools, and techniques necessary to efficiently, effectively, and ethically apply network analysis to understand and improve learning and the contexts in which learning occurs.

The following learning objectives are aligned with the overarching learning objectives of the Graduate Certificate in Learning Analytics program and are embedded in each unit of the course: 

1.  **Conceptual Foundations:** Describe social network theory (e.g. history, concepts, ethics, etc.) and how it has been applied to address important problems, questions, and issues in education;

2.  **Data Sources & Measures:** Identify and appropriately use network data sources (e.g. social media, online discussion forums, etc.) and associated measures (e.g. centrality, degree, etc.);

3.  **Tool Proficiency:** Efficiently and effectively apply up-to-date software and tools (i.e. R, Quarto, GitHub) to implement LA workflows for preparing, analyzing, and sharing data;

4.  **Processes & Techniques**: Understand and apply analytic processes and network analysis techniques (e.g. sociograms, clustering, ERGMs) in order to understand and improve learning and the contexts in which learning occurs; and, 

5.  **Communication:** Clearly communicate methods, analyses, findings, and recommendations that can provide actionable insight into learning contexts for a range of education stakeholders.

## **Course Structure**

This course is divided into three-week units focused on common techniques associated with social network theory and analysis. Week 1 of each unit consists of course **Readings and Discussion** designed to introduce key terminology, core concepts, and applications of SNA in Education. The second week of each unit is guided by a network **Case Study** and focuses on applying network analysis to gain insight into a network data set. During the final week of each unit, students will continue to develop technical skills through either an **Independent Analysis** for those comfortable students who have completed ECI 586, or R tutorials available through [Posit Cloud](https://posit.cloud/learn/primers).

### **Unit 1: The Social Network Perspective**

The Social Network Perspective is a gentle introduction to social network theory, analysis and applications in education. The course **Readings and Discussion** in this unit will help students gain a general understanding of key social network theory, concepts, and applications in education, as well how researchers manage and represent network data. Our unit **Case Study: Who's Friends with Who in Middle School** is guided by the work of [Pittinsky and Carolan (2008)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11218-007-9046-7) and compares teacher perceptions and student reports of classroom middle school friendship. Finally, the **Independent Analysis** provides an opportunity to further explore our middle school datasets and create your own data product that highlights the knowledge and skills gained in Unit 1. Students new to R are required to complete an alternative assignment consisting of R tutorials available through [Posit Cloud](https://posit.cloud/learn/primers).

### **Unit 2: Network Methods and Measures**

Network Methods and Measures moves beyond basic concepts of network analysis and takes a closer look at the collection, management, and measurement of network data. Our course **Readings and Discussion** examine the different levels at which social networks can be analyzed, as well as common network measures for describing properties of complete networks. Our unit **Case Study: A Tale of Two MOOCs** compares discussion networks from two courses using an open educational dataset prepared by [Kellogg and Edelman (2015)](https://bera-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/bjet.12312) as part of the Friday Institute's work around Massively Open Online Courses for Educators (MOOC-Eds). Finally, the **Independent Analysis** provides an opportunity to further explore our MOOC-Ed dataset and create your own data product that highlights the knowledge and skills gained in this. Students new to R are required to complete an alternative assignment consisting of R tutorials available through [Posit Cloud](https://posit.cloud/learn/primers).

### **Unit 3: Groups, Positions and Egocentric Analysis**

Groups, Positions and Egocentric Analysis shifts the focus from complete network analysis and zooms in on methods and measures for analyzing groups, positions, and individual actors. Our course **Readings and Discussion** and case study explore both "top-down" and "bottom-up" approaches to identify a network's groups and extend measures introduced in the previous lab to identify individuals central to the network. Our unit **Case Study: Components, Cliques, & Key Actors** is inspired by the work of Supovitz et al. who examined groups and key actors that emerged during the intense Twitter debate surrounding the Common Core State Standards. You can learn more about their work on the expansive and interactive website for the [#COMMONCORE Project](https://www.hashtagcommoncore.com/). Finally, the **Independent Analysis** provides an opportunity to further explore our Twitter dataset and create your own data product that highlights the knowledge and skills gained in this. Students new to R are required to complete an alternative assignment consisting of R tutorials available through [Posit Cloud](https://posit.cloud/learn/primers).

### **Unit 4: Statistical Inference and Network Selection**

Statistical Inference and Network Selection wraps up our work with SNA and examines recent advances in inferential statistics that can be used to make predictions from social network data and test hypotheses we have about a network of interest. Through our course **Readings and Discussion**, we'll learn about different techniques that make use of simulations to model network data and how these statistical models are used to address questions that more completely reflect the complexity of educational settings. For example, our unit **Case Study: Birds of a Feather Lead Together** is inspired by the work of Daly and Finnigan (2016) makes use of Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGMs) to examine social processes (e.g. reciprocity and homophily) that might explain how school and district-level leaders select peers for collaboration or confidential exchanges. Finally, the **Independent Analysis** provides an opportunity to further explore our school leadership datasets and create your own data product that highlights the knowledge and skills gained in this. Students new to R are required to complete an alternative assignment consisting of R tutorials available through [Posit Cloud](https://posit.cloud/learn/primers).

## **Assignments and Grading**

### Major Course Assignments

1.  **Housekeeping (4 pts)**: Students will review Syllabus, access necessary software and post a brief introduction of themselves and respond to their peers.
