# Social Network Analysis and Education

## **Course Overview**

Although social network analysis and its educational antecedents date back to the early 1900s, the popularity of social networking sites like Twitter and Facebook have raised awareness of and renewed interests in networks and their influence. As the use of digital resources continues expand in education, data collected by these educational technologies has also greatly facilitated the application of network analysis to teaching and learning. This introductory course is designed to prepare researchers and practitioners to apply network analysis in order to better understand and improve student learning and the contexts in which learning occurs. This course will provide students with an overview of social network theory, examples of network analysis in educational contexts, and applied experience with widely adopted tools and techniques. As participants gain experience in the collection, analysis, and reporting of data throughout the course, they will be better prepared help educational organizations understand and improve both online and blended learning environments.

## **Course Goals**

Goals for the Analyzing Learning Networks course are guided by the North Carolina State University motto: Think and Do. Specifically, goals for this course are twofold:

1.  **Disciplinary Knowledge.** Students will deepen their understanding of Social Network Analysis as an emerging approach within the field of Learning Analytics, including its application in a wide range of education settings.

2.  **Technical Skills.** Scholars will develop proficiency with the processes, tools, and techniques necessary to efficiently, effectively, and ethically apply network analysis to understand and improve learning and the contexts in which learning occurs. 

## **Student Learning Outcomes**

The following learning objectives are aligned with the overarching learning objectives of the Graduate Certificate in Learning Analytics program and are embedded in each unit of the course. Student who complete this course will be able to:

1.  **Conceptual Foundations:** Describe social network theory (e.g. history, concepts, ethics, etc.) and how it has been applied to address important problems, questions, and issues in education;

2.  **Data Sources & Measures:** Identify and appropriately use network data sources (e.g. social media, online discussion forums, etc.) and associated measures (e.g. centrality, degree, etc.);

3.  **Tool Proficiency:** Efficiently and effectively apply up-to-date software and tools (i.e. R or Gephi) to implement LA workflows for preparing, analyzing, and sharing data;

4.  **Processes & Techniques**: Understand and apply analytic processes and network analysis techniques (e.g. sociograms, clustering, ERGMs) in order to understand and improve learning and the contexts in which learning occurs; and, 

5.  **Communication:** Clearly communicate methods, analyses, findings, and recommendations that can provide actionable insight into learning contexts for a range of education stakeholders.

## **Course Structure & Schedule**

This course is divided into 4 four-week units focused on common techniques associated with social network theory and analysis. Part 1 of each unit introduce terminology, core concepts, and applications of an analytical approach through readings, course videos, and discussion. Part 2 focuses on applying knowledge acquired in Part 1 to gain insight into text-based data sources. Students will also develop technical skills through various tutorials and apply these skills to design and implement a self-directed analysis of a data source of their choosing.
